GNU Radio AM Transmitter

This gnuradio-companion file will create an AM transmitter, using a wav file for the source.  
Set the audio_sample_rate variable to match the bitrate of the audio file.  
You can adjust the audio gain, or disable it completely.  
The frequency sink isn't required. The only reason it's there is to give an idea of what would be coming out of the HackRF.
